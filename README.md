## Examples

### Test Names Should Influence Object's API

<details>

```javascript
it("should be empty when initialized", () => {
  let world = new World();
  expect(world.livingCells().count).toEqual(0);
})

it("should be able to add new a cell", () => {
  let world = new World();
  world.setLivingAt(1, 1);
  expect(world.livingCells().count).toEqual(1);
})
```

The test name talks about an empty world. The test code, however, has no concept of an empty world.

When we write our test, we should be spending time on our test names. We want them to describe both the behavior of the
system and the way we expect to use the component under test.

```javascript
it("should be empty when initialized", () => {
  let world = new World();
  expect(world.isEmpty()).toEqual(true);
})

it("should be not empty after adding a new cell", () => {
  let world = new World();
  let location = new Location(1, 1).coordinate;
  world.setLivingAt(location);
  expect(world.isEmpty()).toEqual(false);
})
```

The above sample hides the internals of the object, while building up a usable API for the rest of the system to
consume.

Focusing on the symmetry between a good test name and the code under tests is a subtle design technique. Next time when
we are flying through our TDD cycle, take a moment to make sure that we are actually testing what we say we are testing.

### Duplication of Knowledge about Topology

```javascript
class World {
  setLivingAt(coordinateX: number, coordinateY: number) {
    const newLivingCell = new LivingCell();
    newLivingCell.positionAt(coordinateX, coordinateY);
    return newLivingCell;
  }
}
```

```javascript
export class World {
  setLivingAt(location: number[]) {
    const newLivingCell = new LivingCell();
    newLivingCell.positionAt(location);
    return newLivingCell;
  }
}
```

### Behavior Attractors

```javascript
class Location {
  neighbours() {
    let neighbourCoordinateList = getNeighbourCoordinates(this.coordinateX, this.coordinateY);
    return neighbourCoordinateList;
  }
}
```

### Testing State vs Testing Behavior

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>
Focus on the behavior rather than the state of the objects. It is about only building the things that are absolutely
needed and only at the time they are needed. This way, we end up with a system that has just enough code to support our
use cases.

What behaviour of my system require this? -

```javascript
it("should be empty when initialized", () => {
  let world = new World();
  expect(world.isEmpty()).toEqual(true);
});
```

The empty world should tick into another empty world.

```javascript
it("should stays empty after a tick", () => {
  // Write test
})
```

Since the test dictates that we start with an empty world, we should probably postpone this test and make sure that a
new world is empty, so we can write the above (origin) test

```javascript
it("should be empty when initialized", () => {
  let world = new World();
  expect(world.isEmpty()).toEqual(true);
});

it("should stays empty after a tick", () => {
  let world = new World();
  const nextWorld = world.tick();
  expect(nextWorld.isEmpty()).toEqual(true);
})
```

</details>

### Don't Have Tests Depend on Previous Tests

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

```javascript
it("should stays empty after a tick", () => {
  let world = new World();
  const nextWorld = world.tick();
  expect(nextWorld.isEmpty()).toEqual(true);
})
```

How do we know that a newly-initialized World is empty? The test name indicates that we are starting with an empty
world, but the test code does not specify this explicitly. This Test implicitly depends on the validity of a different,
previous test: there is an assumption here that new worlds are empty. This causes a subtle, but important, problem; that
lack of explicitness, combined with the coupling to the previous test, makes this test contribute to a fragile test
suite.

```javascript
it("should stays empty after a tick", () => {
  let world = new World().empty;
  const nextWorld = world.tick();
  expect(nextWorld.isEmpty).toEqual(true);
});
```

Ask for an empty world explicitly.

Guideline: There must be an explicitly named builder method on the class to create an object in a specific, valid state.

### Breaking Abstraction Level

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

```javascript
it("should be not empty after adding a new cell", () => {
  let world = new World();
  let location = new Location(1, 1).coordinate;
  world.setLivingAt(location);
  expect(world.isEmpty).toEqual(false);
})
```

In the example above, we are testing the behavior of the world, but we are including details that it isn't concerned
with. By typing the test to the implementation of the 2 dimensions (1,1) rather than the Location abstraction, we are
laying the groundwork for fragile tests. Change the topology (e.g. to 3 dimensions) and the tests fail.

To hide the details of the topology from the world object is to use a stand-in, a test double for the location object.
This can be as simple as creating a new, plain object.

```javascript
it("should be not empty after adding a new cell", () => {
  let world = new World();
  const dummyLocation = [1, 1];
  world.setLivingAt(dummyLocation);
  expect(world.isEmpty).toEqual(false);
})
```

### Naive Duplication

```javascript
export class Cell {
  get aliveInNextGeneration() {
    if (this.isAlive) {
      return this.numberOfNeighbours == 2 || this.numberOfNeighbours == 3;
    } else {
      return this.numberOfNeighbours == 3
    }
  }
}
```

Refactoring from above to below code by eliminating "duplication of code" without understanding the knowledge behind
introduces confusion of the expression of the code. DRY principle states:
> Every piece of _knowledge_ has one and only one representation

Knowledge â‰  Code. Just combining code that appears similar and combining them misses the point of the DRY principle.

The 3s are not the same.

```javascript
export class Cell {
  get aliveInNextGeneration() {
    return (this.isAlive && this.numberOfNeighbours == 2) || this.numberOfNeighbours == 3;
  }
}
```

After refactoring to below, we can see clearly that hte 3s represent different things. This is the power of paying close
attention to the expressiveness of our code before blindly trying to eliminate duplication.

```javascript
export class Cell {
  get aliveInNextGeneration() {
    if (this.isAlive) {
      return this.isStableNeighborhood();
    } else {
      return this.isGeneticallyFertileNeighbourhood();
    }
  }
}
```
